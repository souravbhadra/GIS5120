# Project

The class project is a significant component of your learning experience, contributing 25% to your final grade. This project is an opportunity for you to apply the geospatial analytics concepts and techniques we've explored throughout the course to a real-world problem. You are expected to work individually to develop an original project that showcases your analytical skills, creativity, and understanding of geospatial data.

## Major Expectations

- **Originality:** Your project must be original, demonstrating your approach to solving a geospatial problem. It should reflect your ability to think critically and innovatively within the field of geospatial analytics.
  - You do not need to find a novel algorithm or method, but you CANNOT just complete a tutorial from YouTube and submit it as a project. Explore different geospatial projects in research articles, LinkedIn, Medium, or GitHub and try to apply a different set of data to make a slightly different inference. Start thinking about your project as soon as possible.
  - The project can be related to your dissertation or thesis research. Please ask your PI for permission before using your own research data as part of the class project.
  - The project must include one or more geospatial analytics techniques we are covering in this course. I know its too early to decide as we have not gone through the lectures yet, but please look at the [schedule](schedule.md) for more information about what type of topics will be covered.
  - Please reach out to me about your project topic if you have confusion.

- **PowerPoint Presentation:** You will present your project to the class in a concise PowerPoint presentation. This presentation should clearly communicate your projectâ€™s objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. More details will follow.
  - The presentation is for 10 minutes with short Q&A.
  - You should at least include the background of your problem, clearly state your objectives, the methods, results, discussions and conlcusions.

- **Short Report:** Along with your presentation, you will submit a short report (3-4 pages) summarizing your project. The report should include an introduction, a detailed explanation of your methods, your findings, and your conclusions. It should be clear, well-organized, and professionally written. More details will follow.

The class project is your chance to demonstrate your mastery of geospatial analytics, so take this opportunity to showcase your skills and insights.

## Rubrics

The overall grade for the class project is 25% of your total grade. Within this 25%, following are the major points totaling to 100, which will be weighted by the 25% weight:

|                                   | Points |
|-----------------------------------|--------|
| **Abstract**                      | 5      |
| **Research**                      | 50     |
| **Oral Presentation**             | 20     |
| **Short Report**                  | 25     |

### Abstract

Please submit your project abstract on Canvas by **October 29, 2024, 10:00 PM CDT**. The abstract is worth 5 points and contributes to your overall project grade. Your abstract should be no longer than 250 words and must include a title followed by a concise overview of your project.

Your abstract should follow the structure typically used in scientific publications:

1. **Introduction:** Briefly introduce your topic and define the main problem.
2. **Research Question and Objective:** State the key research question, the objectives of your project, and explain why this work is important. Highlight who could benefit from the findings.
3. **Methods and Data:** Describe the methods you will use and the datasets required for your analysis.
4. **Expected Results and Hypothesis:** Outline the type of results you expect to achieve, and if applicable, mention any hypotheses you are testing.

Please submit your abstract as a Word document.

### Research

Here is a breakdown of the **Research** component. By **Research**, I am emphasizing the actual work of the class project. Let's say you have provided a great presentation and report, but the research side is weak, this can affect your overall grade. Also this can occur vice-versa. These are breakdown of points which totals to 100:
