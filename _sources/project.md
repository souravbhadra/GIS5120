# Project

The class project is a significant component of your learning experience, contributing 25% to your final grade. This project is an opportunity for you to apply the geospatial analytics concepts and techniques we've explored throughout the course to a real-world problem. You are expected to work individually to develop an original project that showcases your analytical skills, creativity, and understanding of geospatial data.

## Major Expectations

- **Originality:** Your project must be original, demonstrating your approach to solving a geospatial problem. It should reflect your ability to think critically and innovatively within the field of geospatial analytics.
  - You do not need to find a novel algorithm or method, but you CANNOT just complete a tutorial from YouTube and submit it as a project. Explore different geospatial projects in research articles, LinkedIn, Medium, or GitHub and try to apply a different set of data to make a slightly different inference. Start thinking about your project as soon as possible.
  - The project can be related to your dissertation or thesis research. Please ask your PI for permission before using your own research data as part of the class project.
  - The project must include one or more geospatial analytics techniques we are covering in this course. I know its too early to decide as we have not gone through the lectures yet, but please look at the [schedule](schedule.md) for more information about what type of topics will be covered.
  - Please reach out to me about your project topic if you have confusion.

- **PowerPoint Presentation:** You will present your project to the class in a concise PowerPoint presentation. This presentation should clearly communicate your projectâ€™s objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions. More details will follow.
  - The presentation is for 10 minutes with short Q&A.
  - You should at least include the background of your problem, clearly state your objectives, the methods, results, discussions and conlcusions.

- **Short Report:** Along with your presentation, you will submit a short report (3-4 pages) summarizing your project. The report should include an introduction, a detailed explanation of your methods, your findings, and your conclusions. It should be clear, well-organized, and professionally written. More details will follow.

The class project is your chance to demonstrate your mastery of geospatial analytics, so take this opportunity to showcase your skills and insights.
