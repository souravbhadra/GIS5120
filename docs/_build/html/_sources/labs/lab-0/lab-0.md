# Make a Map

- This assignment tests your understanding of how well you understand maps and ArcGIS Pro. It is part of the lab assignments but there is no lab manual.
- You literally make any thematic map in ArcGIS Pro. As the name suggests, it has to follow a specific theme. You CANNOT simply put some geospatial data together, it must convey a story or message or information.

## Requirements of the map

1. Title of the map, short title should state the main message of the map
2. Use public data only (please do not use privately collected data, such as, your hiking trail in Yellowstone this summer)
3. Map must have north arrow, scale bar, necessary legends, and projection system you used.
4. You are welcome to provide additional information.
5. As long as you adhere to these requirements, you will get full marks. I will not judge your aesthetic ability at this moment So, feel free to experiment.
6. Do NOT put your name in the map.

## Deliverables

- An exported PNG of the map in 300 DPI.
- Associated ArcGIS Pro files in a zip format.
