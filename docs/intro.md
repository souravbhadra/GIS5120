## Course Description

This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts and frameworks of spatial analysis, emphasizing the role of geospatial technology in addressing grand societal challenges. Students will explore a range of topics, including spatial analysis processes, data exploration, surface and field analysis, and the application of Python and big data in geospatial contexts. At the end of the course, students will be able to tackle a geospatial analytics project including data collection, data processing, analysis and making inference like a geospatial scientist.  

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

- Explain and apply fundamental concepts of spatial analysis.
- Explore and analyze spatial data using statistical methods.
- Conduct surface and field analyses, including geometry and interpolation.
- Use Python and geospatial tools for complex analyses.
- Analyze and interpret multidimensional climate data.
- Design, execute, and present a geospatial analysis project.
